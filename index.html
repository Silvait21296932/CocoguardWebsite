                            <p>Recent studies have applied CNNs like MobileNetV2 for pest detection, yet they often rely on post-harvest, high-resolution images under controlled conditions. CocoGuard addresses this gap by combining Real-ESRGAN for image enhancement with MobileNetV2 to detect Aceria guerreronis (coconut mite) infestations directly from mobile phone images in the field.</p>

                            <p>How can we accurately detect pests, diseases, nutrient imbalances, and maturity stages in coconut farming to improve productivity and decision-making for Sri Lankan farmers?</p>
                            <p>Addressing the critical issues in coconut cultivation—including pest infestation, foliar diseases, soil mismanagement, and inconsistent harvest timing—requires a unified, intelligent system. Traditional methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and lack scalability. Early detection and personalized insights are essential to reduce crop loss, improve yield, and promote sustainable farming practices.</p>

                            <p>CocoGuard presents an end-to-end AI and IoT-based mobile platform that empowers farmers with real-time monitoring and intelligent insights for coconut farming. It integrates four smart modules:
                                1.	Pest Detection: Enhances in-field nut images using Real-ESRGAN and classifies coconut mite infestations with MobileNetV2.
                                2.	Disease Identification: Detects Grey Leaf Spot with high accuracy using CNNs and boosts interpretability using Grad-CAM++ and LIME.
                                3.	Soil Fertility Management: Employs IoT sensors and Random Forest models to provide precise NPK fertilizer recommendations based on live field data.
                                4.	Harvest Prediction: Combines image-based maturity classification with yield history using Random Forest regression to suggest optimal harvest timing.
                            
                            This unified system runs via a React Native app and Flask backend, ensuring real-time image processing, field data analysis, and smart alerts. By combining deep learning, explainable AI, and IoT, CocoGuard transforms traditional coconut farming into a data-driven, efficient, and sustainable agricultural model.</p>

                                <h4>Pest Detection (Coconut Mite – Ravindu Balasooriya)</h4>
                                <p>The main objective is to develop an intelligent mobile-based system for early detection of coconut mite infestations directly on trees using field images. The system enhances low-quality images captured by farmers using Real-ESRGAN and classifies them with a lightweight MobileNetV2 model. It aims to minimize crop damage by providing timely identification of Aceria guerreronis infestations. Additional goals include improving model robustness through data augmentation, deploying predictions via a user-friendly app, and ensuring the model functions effectively under varying lighting and camera conditions to support widespread, real-time use in low-resource agricultural settings.</p>

A MobileNetV2 model classifies leaf images into healthy, infected, or non-coconut categories. To address trust and transparency, the system integrates Grad-CAM++ and LIME for visual explanation of predictions. The goal is to provide early, accurate disease identification while enhancing farmer trust in AI-based systems. Additional objectives include dataset creation using both field and synthetic images, optimizing the model for mobile deployment, and building an intuitive frontend that supports efficient image uploading and result interpretation.</p>

MobileNetV2 is used for real-time image classification, while a Random Forest regression model is trained on user-inputted harvest records such as yield volume, date, and location. The system aims to help farmers make data-driven decisions for maximizing harvest quality and reducing premature or delayed harvesting.

A custom device collects NPK, pH, temperature, and humidity data using sensors, which is processed by a Random Forest model to provide fertilizer guidance specific to each field. The system addresses the lack of localized nutrient insights and aims to reduce overuse or underuse of fertilizers. Supporting objectives include comparing multiple ML models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting), optimizing sensor accuracy, integrating a React Native app for user interaction, and promoting precision agriculture through sustainable fertilizer application practices.</p>
